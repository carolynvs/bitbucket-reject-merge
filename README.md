Reject Merge Commit Hook
========================

[Download the latest version from Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.carolynvs.reject-merge-commit-hook)

This is a pre-receive hook plugin for Atlassian Bitbucket Server. It rejects trivial merges and keeps your history clean and linear by enforcing a workflow which prefers using 'git pull --rebase'.


If you think `-*-*-*-` is better than  

```
                                        /*\
                                     --/-*-\-*-*
                                            \*/
```

then this plugin is for you!
